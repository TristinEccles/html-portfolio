<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Tristin, and I like to think of myself as an individual with a zest for life. There are many different things that 
  define who I am, and I'm happy to share them with you.</p>

<p>My heart overflows with love for my family. They are the center of my universe, and their well-being means the world to me. Spending quality
time with them is an essential part of my life, and we share an unbreakable bond. Whether it's our adventurous hiking tips, parties with
our extended family, or dancing in the kitchen, I treasure every moment we get to spend together. </p>

<p>Another passion of mine is the outdoors. There is something enchanting about nature that fascinates me every time I step outside. From hiking 
through forests, exploring our magnificent mountain, or simply walking around the neighborhood brings me such an immense amount of joy.
Nature always has a way of recharging my mind and body.</p>

<p>If I'm not out exploring, you can often find me in the kitchen baking up a storm. It's my creative outlet and gives me a sense of 
  accomplishment knowing that I can combine such simple ingredients and turn them into something delicious. I love being able to share my
  baked goods with my friends and family too! My favorite things to replicate are Crumbl Cookies or family recipes, but my favorite
  thing to eat is chocolate chip banana bread.</p>

  <p>Don't be fooled by the image of a serene baker - I have another passion that fuels my inner fire, and that's kickboxing! Pushing my
    physical limits, perfecting my technique, and breaking a sweat is exhilarating. I feel so mentally and physically empowered when 
    kickboxing, and it's an amazing way to release any built-up stress.</p>

    <p>For the rare moments I find time to indulge and unwind, I turn on some video games. I enjoy the fact that I can explore
      a variety of imaginative worlds and narratives. Whether it's a battle royale game, adventure game, or simulation, I find that video
      games are a great hobby that allows me to unwind and have fun.</p>

      <p>While I'm sure I share more passions than above, these shape who I am and help bring balance to my life. I'm so 
        thankful for the diverse beauty the world has to offer. Thanks for taking the time to read and learn more about me!</p>
